/*Write a program that reads the integers between 1 and 100 and counts the occurrences of each.

Assume the input ends with 0.

Sample Run

Enter the integers between 1 and 100: 2 5 6 5 4 3 23 43 2 0
2 occurs 2 times
3 occurs 1 time
4 occurs 1 time
5 occurs 2 times
6 occurs 1 time
23 occurs 1 time
43 occurs 1 time

Note that if a number occurs more than one time, the plural word “times” is used in the output. Also note that the numbers are displayed in increasing order.
